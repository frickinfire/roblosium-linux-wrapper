## THIS IS AN OLD VERSION OF ROBLOX-LINUX-WRAPPER. 
 I DID NOT WRITE THIS, I JUST MODIFIED IT. PLEASE [SUPPORT THE DEVS](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper) 
 
 
## Information
This script is neither created nor officially supported by Roblox. It is unofficial and may be unstable. Use at your own risk. To install wine, please [see the official WineHQ documentation](https://www.winehq.org/download/) on how to install the appropriate version of Wine for your system. This program does not install Wine for you.

## Installation

### .deb (Debian/Ubuntu)

We provide `.deb` binaries for Debian / Ubuntu users on the [releases page](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/releases).

Debian/Ubuntu users can also use GLolol's repository at http://packages.overdrive.pw/:

1) Run the following command to add the repository:

```shell
echo 'deb http://packages.overdrive.pw/ rlw main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null 
```

2) Install the repository's PGP key (this will prevent unauthenticated package errors):

```shell
wget -O /tmp/sub.class1.server.ca.pem https://www.startssl.com/certs/sub.class1.server.ca.pem
wget --ca-certificate=/tmp/sub.class1.server.ca.pem -O - https://secure.overdrive.pw/repo.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

3) Install the Roblox Linux Wrapper package. Dependencies will be automatically installed, and updates applied automatically when you upgrade your system:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install roblox-linux-wrapper
```

### source (via `git clone`)

To install Roblox on your Linux computer from Git source, run the following commands in a terminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper.git
cd roblox-linux-wrapper
./rlw
```

If you are saavy enough, you can also clone to a custom directory of your choice.

## Updates

Roblox Linux Wrapper is very volatile, and updates are released very often, so please check for updates frequently.

### `.deb
* Note the version you have installed.
* If the version present [here](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/releases) is newer, download it and install it via your package manager.
* If you have enabled the APT repository, updates to the wrapper will come with system updates in the next release.

### from Git source
* Open a terminal, change to the directory you installed.
* Run `git pull` inside the terminal while in that directory.

## Diagnosing the game
Often times, a Roblox update breaks compatibility with the Roblox Linux Wrapper. Many of these changes will require an update to wine, which may come out months after the issue is introduced. In order to circumvent this issue, the wrapper now allows you to choose either wine or wine-staging, to allow you to use the release of wine that works best for you. It will ask you upon launching, and there is also an option labelled "Select Wine Release" in the launcher.
* If wine works fine, keep using wine.
* If wine-staging works, keep using it. Do note that wine-staging is pre-release software - you may encounter issues.

## Questions and Answers

* Q: How do I install this?
  * A: See the Installation section.

* Q: What do I do if the game is very slow?
  * A: Open Roblox Studio settings, change `graphicsMode` to `OpenGL`.

* Q: It tells me there is a syntax error, or I'm having another problem.
  * A: Download the script again and retry. If the same thing occurs, [open a new issue here](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/issues).

* Q: Roblox isn't behaving like it should.
  * A: Select the "Reinstall Roblox" option and press "Ok". If you continue having problems, [file a bug report here](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/issues).

* Q: What is the "Play Roblox (Legacy Mode)" option?
  * A: This is the old method used to launch games. Paste the game link in and click "Play" to launch the game.

* Q: It keeps telling me "Missing Dependencies"!
  * A: Then install it! If it tells you "Please install wine", then install Wine. It does not install these dependencies automatically. To install the latest version of Wine, visit https://www.winehq.org/download/.


## Required Dependencies

* git
